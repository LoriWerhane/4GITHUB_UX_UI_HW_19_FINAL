      <div><h3>COATS FOR COLORADO CASE STUDY OVERVIEW</h3>
        <p>Coats for Colorado, a local nonprofit organization had an outdated website that was not providing enough information to its primary user.</p>
        
         <h4>THE CHALLENGE</h4>
         <p>How can we make Coats for Colorado a better resource for the more than 120 nonprofit network partners who distribute the coats. </p>

         <h4>THE SOLUTION</h4>
         <p>We were able redesign the Coats for Colorado website with a Responsive Web Design mobile version as well. After multiple rounds of testing and iterations, the final result is a website that is more useful to the Coats for Colorado user. </p>

        <div><h3>GOVERNMENT WEBSITE REDESIGN</h3><h3>CASE STUDY OVERVIEW</h3>
          <p> A project to redesign a government website.</p>
          
          <h4>THE CHALLENGE</h4>
          
          <p>The Department of Labor website looked nice, but was not user friendly. Menus were not focuses on the users coming to the website and lnks often too users to external websites that felt fraudulent. How can I make the website a more useful, less stressful experience overall.  </p>
          <h4>THE SOLUTION</h4>
          <p>The Department of Labor website was heavy with page after page of agencies, acronyms, and links. I also discovered users were often redirected to external websites that did not feel safe to them. This also resulted in significantly more clicks and confusion about where they were. While some of the website had nice photography and graphics, not being able to find information quickly was anxiety producing for users -- often during the toughest time of their lives. Making the website more focused on the user created a space where valuable resources and information could be accessed -- and lives made better. Simplifying those paths would also make finding information easier. </p>

          <div><h3>MOBILE APP CASE STUDY OVERVIEW</h3>
            <p>Project to design an app to solve an everyday problem.</p>
            <h4>THE CHALLENGE</h4>
            <p> Our group decided to create an app to support the need to gracefully and safely exit the array of modern dating/social interactions.  </p>
            <h4>THE SOLUTION</h4>
            <p>When we first brainstormed to come up with an app idea that would solve an everyday problem we thought this would be a fun, dating type app. As we dug into research we learned that people actually feel unsafe in social situations a lot. Taking this idea and elevating it into a tool to help young adults feel safer in social situations became the goal. We also felt the app would be beneficial for folks who are shy entering social situations. Having an easy “OUT” might make them socialize more often.  </p>

            <div><h3>MOBILE APP CASE STUDY OVERVIEW</h3>
              <p>Project to design a travel app from scratch.</p>
              <h4>THE CHALLENGE</h4>
              <p>Modern travelers really like to use their own rewards programs, favorite airline/hotel websites to research travel. However, plans coming in from so many places can be an organizational nightmare -- causing unnecessary stress and frustration.  </p>
              <h4>THE SOLUTION</h4>
               <p>I went into the project expecting to create an app to help travelers save money. After conducting research interviews, I learned most of my users actually find the process of planning a trip to be very stressful. Research shows the less stressful the planning process is, the more users will travel, the more activities they will plan, and ultimately the more money they will spend on travel. WIN WIN!</p>
